# (Hard)Core Training

## Introduction

Vue Storefront is getting more and more popular with more than 20 sites running on production. By the same time, the VSF Framework evolves with each new release and the docs are hardly trying to follow! 

These training materials are a set of Chief-recipes, experiences learned from the trenches. Iâ€™m trying to answer how to run Vue Storefront on production, troubleshoot most of the common problems and explain all the hidden features of Vue Storefront that can help you scale the application and solve most common issues.

Some of the topics here were found as a [frequently asked questions from our Forum](https://forum.vuestorefront.io/c/help). Some [came from Slack](http://slack.vuestorefront.io). Some came from core-consulting and our own works. What's common: all are super-crucial for stable Vue Storefront run on production and all are resulting some (hard)core results when done wrong.

## Tip 1: Memory leaks
Vue Storefront consist of two NodeJS applications:
- `vue-storefront` - which is the frontend app, with the entry point of [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/4ed26d7f1978a9e798edcddf1cf2f970c3e64e4f/core/scripts/server.js#L269)
- `vue-storefornt-api` - which is backend/api app.

If you're familiar with PHP apps and running PHP on production (for example using fastCGI or FPM) - NodeJS works totally different way. It's not executing `node` process per each request but rather running an internal http server which serves all the subsequent requests. It's single threaded, long running task. Because of that specific it's fairly easy to get into memory leaks problems; especially with the `vue-storefront` app which is far more complex than the API.

How did you know you encounter the memory leaks? The `pm2` [memory ussage](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/monitoring/) (`yarn pm2 status` or `yarn pm2 monit` for details) is growing with each page refresh.

Vue.js docs has pretty good section on [how to avoid Vue.js memory leaks](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/avoiding-memory-leaks.html). 

One of the key points there is that you should avoid `Vue.use` and make sure it's called always just `once`. In the Vue Storefront code you can pretty often find a snippet like this:

```js
import { once } from '@vue-storefront/core/helpers'
once('__VUE_EXTEND_RR__', () => {
  Vue.use(VueRouter)
})
```
Feel free to use it around all your plugins and mixins instantiation. 

Another thing is to properly handle the events. Each `EventBus.$on` must have it's `EventBus.$off`. Please avoid the situation where **you bind the event in `created`  whenever possible**. The `created` is called in the SSR mode; if you bind in `beforeMount` it will be executed only in the CSR (client's browser) which is 99% desired behavior and you not risk the memory leaks on events.

### Quick wins

- PM2 is restarting the process after [1GB of RAM (by default)](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/4ed26d7f1978a9e798edcddf1cf2f970c3e64e4f/docs/guide/cookbook/hardcore.md#L49) - this can be adjusted and together with multiple node `instances` set in `ecosystem.json` it's pretty good work-around for memory leaks,
- We do have an **SSR Output Cache** in which rendered pages are stored in the Redis memory cache so no Vue SSR Renderer is being used; you just need to remember about the cache invalidation (there is a Tip for that in this doc). Output cache usually solves the memory leak issue the hard way - without eliminating the root cause. [Read more how to set it up](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/basics/ssr-cache.html)
- Make sure you're having `runInNewContext` set to `true` (default value!) in [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/4ed26d7f1978a9e798edcddf1cf2f970c3e64e4f/docs/guide/cookbook/hardcore.md#L64); without it the [Stateful Singletons](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/issues/2664) like `RouteManager` or `i18n` we're using will cause the memory leaks at huuge scale,
- We do have an **Static Pages Generator** - currently experimental feature - can generate the whole site into set of static HTML files so they could be served even directly from cloud provider/CDN - no memory leaks possible; waht you need to take care of in this mode is cache invalidation (not currently supported but easy to add). [Read more on static page generator](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/pull/3256),
- In case of any concerns [find out how we dealt with memory leaks](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+memory+is%3Aclosed+leak) in Vue Storefront core - and check if any of those edge cases can be a case for your project.

### Tracing memory leaks

There are many ways to trace the memory leaks, however we're using the browser tools (Memory profile) most of the times. [Here you have it explained in details](https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/04/03/how-to-track-and-fix-memory-leak-with-nodejs.html). Another usefull tools are [New Relic APM](http://newrelic.com) and [Google Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup/nodejs)

## Tip2: SSR Output cache

Vue Storefront supports [Server Side Rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html). In this mode the same code which is being executed be the browser in browser (CSR; Client Side Rendering) runs on the srver in order to generate the HTML markup. The markup is being transfered to the browser, rendered (extremly fast as the browsers were all optimized to ... render html text by the last 20+ years) and [hydrated](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/hydration.html) from the [initial state](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/data.html#final-state-injection). By this whole procedure the client side / browser scripts can use exactly the same code base (Universal). Another cool feature is that static HTML markup is well indexed by Search Engine crawlers which is extremly important for SEO.

Usually, Vue Storefront works pretty fast and all SSR requests are being finished in between 100-300ms; however, if your database is huuuge or your server resources are low, or probably the traffic is extremly high you might want to enable the output cache. The other reason is that you might want to use SSR cache to prevent memory leaks - well, rather hide them :-)

The SSR cache is [pretty well documented in our docs](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/basics/ssr-cache.html). What's important it works for both: `vue-storefront` and `vue-storefront-api`.
[Read on all the caching mechanisms](https://medium.com/the-vue-storefront-journal/caching-on-production-10b00a5614f8) that Vue Storefront is using.

In the SSR Output cache mode enabled, the [`core/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L187) stores the rendered output pages along with http headers into Redis cache. If the page exists in Redis - is being served without even starting the Vue SSR Renderer.

We're using Redis in order to use the [`redis-tagging`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-tagging) library. Naming and caching are two most ddifficult areas of software development. Cache tagging helps us to deal with cache invalidation.

We're tagging the output pages with [product](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/helpers/search.ts#L69) and [category](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/store/category/actions.ts#L121) tags. Then all the indexers including: `magento1-vsbridge-indexer`, `mage2vuestorefront`, `magento2-vsbridge-indexer` will invalidate the cache, by specific product or category ID. It means, the [`invalidate`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L156) method will clear out the cache pages tagged with this specific product id. Note: this URL requires you to pass the invalidation token set in the [config](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/config/default.json#L12).

You can add any number of the specific cache tags - by just extending the [`availableCacheTags`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/config/default.json#L11) and [pushing the tags to `ssrContext`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/pages/Home.js#L19) so they can be used by `core/scripts/server`.

This `context` argument passed to `asyncData()` is actually the same context object used by [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L168), so we're using it as transfer object for passing the tags back and forth between server and Vue.js application.

**Note:** If you have the SSR cache enabled (in the `vue-storefront-api` or `vue-storefront` app) please make sure, you're not using the cache on different layer (for example Varnish or nginx). Otherwise the cache invalidation mechanism won't work. 

The dynamic tags config option: `useOutputCacheTagging` - if set to `true`, Vue Storefront is generating the special HTTP Header `X-VS-Cache-Tags`

```js
res.setHeader('X-VS-Cache-Tags', cacheTags);
```

Cache tags are assigned regarding the products and categories that are used on the specific page. A typical `X-VS-Cache-Tags` tag looks like this:

```
X-VS-Cache-Tags: P1852 P198 C20
```

The tags can be used to invalidate the Varnish cache, if you're using it. [Read more on that](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/cache-api/cache-tags-varnish).

**Note:**  All the official Vue Storefront data indexers including [magento1-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge-indexer), [magento2-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento2-vsbridge-indexer) and [mage2vuestorefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/mage2vuestorefront) support the cache invalidation. If the cache is enabled in both API and Vue Storefront frontend app, please make sure you are properly using the `config.server.invalidateCacheForwardUrl` config variable as the indexers can send the cache invalidate request only to one URL (frontend or backend) and it **should be forwarded**. Please check the default forwarding URLs in the `default.json` and adjust the `key` parameter to the value of `server.invalidateCacheKey`.


## Tip 3: Avoiding prices desynchronization (`alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver`)

Vue Storefront indexers (`magento2-vsbridge-indexer`, `magento1-vsbridge-indexer`, `mage2vuestorefront`) all stores the product prices (before/after catalog rules applied) into the ElasticSearch. Butt ElasticSearch can be easily de-synced or the synchronization can be lagged. To avoid the risk of displaying non current prices to the customers Vue Storefront has at least 3 mechanisms - with the `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` on the top.

**Note:** If you're using the `mage2vuestorefront` for syncing the products please make sure you're syncing the prices **after catalog rules** applied. For this purpose we've a special flags to be set on:

```bash
export PRODUCTS_SPECIAL_PRICES=true
export PRODUCTS_RENDER_PRICES=true
node --harmony cli.js products --removeNonExistent=true --partitions=1
```

When the `config.products.alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` option is on, Vue Storefront will update the prices visible on all the listings and product detail pages **directly from Magento**. The code in charge for this operation is located in the [`doPlatformPricesSync`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L212) helper which is being called from the [`tax/calculateTaxes`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/store/tax/actions.ts#L74) action.

**Note:** This mode works whenever the prices are caluclated server either client's side (`config.tax.calculateServerSide` option).

Check if the [way Vue Storefront syncs the prices](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L216) is exactly what you need, and if not [override this action](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/cookbook/module.html#_2-2-recipe-b-override-vuex-store-with-extendstore).

The `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` mode has two additional options:

1. Clear the prices before sync: `config.products.clearPricesBeforePlatformSync` - when `true`, user won't see the prices cached in Elastic before getting the new prices from Magento
2. Synchronous mode - `config.products.waitForPlatformSync` -  by default the price sync is running in parallel to disyplaing the product or category content. We can make it synchronous (waiting for this process to finish) in order we'd like to have just the current prices from Magento rendered in the HTML markup (SSR; otherwise the prices in SSR will be from Elastic).

More than that - Vue Storefront always get's the **platform totals** (the final prices visible in the shopping cart and the order summary) from Magento/any other backend. There is then no risk we'll see the product at the wrongly set price.

## Tip 4: Avoiding stock desynchronization (`filterOutUnavailableVariants`)

Pretty much the same case like with the Prices (Tip 3) can occur with the product stocks. By default, all the indexers are setting the [stock information right into the product object](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-integration-sdk/blob/tutorial/Format-product.md):

 - it's in the main structure of `product.stock`
 - it's set for the `configurable_children` into `product.configurable_children.stock`.

 This information can be outdated.

 Vue Storefront **by default** checks the current stock information when:
 - [**user is adding product to the cart**](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/store/actions/itemActions.ts#L53) - this is an async sync (similar one is run when browsing the product variants - you can get info like `0 items available` when switching colors and sizes); `Checkout.js` is waiting for all the results from the [`stock/queueCheck`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/pages/Checkout.js#L69) calls,
 - when the **cart is synced** with the server - eCommerce backend [checks the product availability once again](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/store/actions/mergeActions.ts#L45) and [notify user](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/components/AddToCart.ts#L31) if the product can't be added to the cart or restores previous quantity (if changed),
 - when the `filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode is on and the user a) enters the product page, b) browses the category pages.

 The `config.products.filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode is pretty interesting thing because only by having this mode switched on you can be sure we're **not displaying unavailable variants**. When it's true Vue Storefront is taking the Stock information out of Magento and updates the `product.stock` info for the whole product list + product page (current product). Then it removes all the `configurable_children` that are not avaialable. [See the detailed implementation](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L121).

There are two additional settings for this mode on:
 - `config.prodducts.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStatic` - when this is true, Vue Storefront is prefetching the stock info for the statically set number of product, it can be configured by `config.products.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStaticPrefetchCount`,
 - `config.prodducts.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchDynamic` - when this is set to true, Vue Storefront is prefetching the stock info for any visible product; it's done in the [`ProductTile.vue](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/src/themes/default/components/core/ProductTile.vue#L108) - make sure your theme is supporting this.
    
We've got the limited support for Magento MSI in the default implementation. [Make sure you've got it enabled when on Magento 2.3.x](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/pull/226).

**Note:** This feature might then be used for the **Donut caching** strategies (related to Tip 2 - SSR cache).

**Note:** If you need to avoid Magento stock calls there is a way by getting the data with the same format as `https://vue-storefront-api/api/stock/list` is returning but from Elastic. It should be a drop-in replacement - I [mean changing the `stock.endpoint`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/bb9044d6aaa36d4881733876f4646fabe7b6e102/config/default.json#L368) to this new one. Et viola: you avoid asking Magento, still having this 'cache punch holing' with `config.products.filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode on

There is a ready made endpoint for getting stock from Elastic (not from Magento) [is here #PR330](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/pull/330).

**Troubleshooting:** If the non-existing variants won't disappear that means some frontend work on your side needs to be done. I mean - with this `filterOutUnavailableVariants` setting, we're pulling the current stock info to `product.stock` and `product.configurable_children.stock` properties. By those properties updated we're then removing the out-of-stock `configurable_children`.
If the variants arer still available then [take a look at this line](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/store/product/actions.ts#L629) and there should be a change made like:

from:

```js
        if (isServer) {
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product }))
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }))
        } else {
          attributesPromise.then(() => context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product })) // if this is client's side request postpone breadcrumbs setup till attributes are loaded to avoid too-early breadcrumb switch #2469
          context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }) // exec async
        }
```
to:

```js
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }))
        if (isServer) {
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product }))
        } else {
          attributesPromise.then(() => context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product })) // if this is client's side request postpone breadcrumbs setup till attributes are loaded to avoid too-early breadcrumb switch #2469
        }
```

Just in order to make sure that attribute filtering always takes place before rendering the PDP.
