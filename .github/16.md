This is the official release of Vue Storefront 1.6. 

This release was mostly focused on introducing new modular architectiure along with default theme cleanup from core logic. 
It's a rather big release in terms of changes. Update can be time consuming but not complicated due to minimal amount of API changes.

See [list of changes and migration guide](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/commit/cc17b5bfa43a9510815aea14dce8bafac382bc7f).
